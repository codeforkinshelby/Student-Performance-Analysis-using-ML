# USING ML CONCEPTS TO ANALYZE STUDENT PERFORMANCE
This is a basic machine learning project done as a mini project as part of my introductory artificial intelligence course in my 3rd semester using classifiers for predicting factors which affect student grades, using data from CSV file.

The dataset contains 17 columns and 500 entries

In this Project, a dataset was downloaded from open source containing attributes of students like  nationalities, different grade levels and also so on. The main advantage of this CSV dataset is that it has parameters other than marks which can be of immense help to analyze one's performance on a holistic note.
Upon this dataset, different classifiers and ML models have been used to get the most accurate predictions of which factors,
affect the marks of students.

A few visual techniques like graphs and confusion matrix have been created, to show the results and for user's reference and better understanding.
